### Preparing your SD Card

The first step, check out the releases page on this repo and download the SD Card zip for your radio (listed above). Unzip the archive and put the contents onto a FAT32-formatted SD Card, then download your preferred voicepack language from the [Voice Generator Repo](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard-sounds/releases/tag/latest) and follow the instuctions on that page to add onto the SD Card.
